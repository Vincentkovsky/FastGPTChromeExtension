# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Chrome extension application that integrates with FastGPT to provide users with AI-powered knowledge base interactions directly from their browser. The extension will guide new users through setting up their FastGPT knowledge base and configuring the necessary connection parameters.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to be guided through the FastGPT setup process, so that I can create my own knowledge base and simple app before using the Chrome extension.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user installs the extension for the first time THEN the system SHALL display an onboarding flow
2. WHEN the onboarding flow starts THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions to visit FastGPT (fastgpt.io or fastgpt.cn)
3. WHEN displaying setup instructions THEN the system SHALL guide users to create a knowledge base in FastGPT
4. WHEN displaying setup instructions THEN the system SHALL guide users to create a simple app in FastGPT
5. WHEN the user completes the FastGPT setup THEN the system SHALL prompt them to return to the extension for configuration

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure my FastGPT connection settings in the Chrome extension, so that I can connect to my specific FastGPT instance and app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user needs to configure the extension THEN the system SHALL provide a settings interface
2. WHEN the settings interface is displayed THEN the system SHALL include input fields for FASTGPT_BASE_URL
3. WHEN the settings interface is displayed THEN the system SHALL include input fields for FASTGPT_APP_ID
4. WHEN the settings interface is displayed THEN the system SHALL include input fields for FASTGPT_API_KEY
5. WHEN a user enters configuration values THEN the system SHALL validate the format of the inputs
6. WHEN a user saves configuration THEN the system SHALL store the settings securely in Chrome storage
7. WHEN invalid configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with my FastGPT knowledge base through the Chrome extension, so that I can get AI-powered responses without leaving my current browsing context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is properly configured THEN the system SHALL provide a chat interface
2. WHEN a user sends a message THEN the system SHALL make API calls to the configured FastGPT instance
3. WHEN the FastGPT API responds THEN the system SHALL display the response in the chat interface
4. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL use the OpenAI-compatible chat completions endpoint
5. WHEN there are API errors THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
6. WHEN the chat interface is active THEN the system SHALL support both streaming and non-streaming responses

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Chrome extension to have an intuitive and accessible interface, so that I can easily navigate between setup, configuration, and chat functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension popup is opened THEN the system SHALL display the appropriate interface based on setup status
2. WHEN the user has not completed setup THEN the system SHALL show the onboarding interface
3. WHEN the user has completed setup but not configured settings THEN the system SHALL show the configuration interface
4. WHEN the user has completed both setup and configuration THEN the system SHALL show the chat interface
5. WHEN in any interface THEN the system SHALL provide navigation options to access settings
6. WHEN displaying interfaces THEN the system SHALL follow modern UI/UX best practices
7. WHEN the extension is used THEN the system SHALL be responsive and work across different screen sizes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want my chat history and settings to persist across browser sessions, so that I can maintain continuity in my interactions with the FastGPT knowledge base.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user configures settings THEN the system SHALL persist the configuration in Chrome storage
2. WHEN a user has chat conversations THEN the system SHALL store chat history locally
3. WHEN the extension is reopened THEN the system SHALL restore previous chat history
4. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL respect user privacy and security best practices
5. WHEN the user wants to clear data THEN the system SHALL provide options to reset settings and clear history
